# Dataset
The dataset comes from Spotify via the spotifyr package. Spotifyr is an R wrapper for pulling track audio features and other information from Spotify’s Web API in bulk. By automatically batching API requests, it allows you to enter an artist’s name and retrieve their entire discography in seconds, along with Spotify’s audio features and track/album popularity metrics.
